## Requirements

Python 3.11 and later is supported.

### Install using pipx

You can install the latest stable release of **greenbone-scap-api** from the
[Python Package Index (pypi)][pypi] using [pipx]

    python3 -m pipx install greenbone-scap-api

### Install using pip

> [!NOTE]
> The `pip install` command does no longer work out-of-the-box in newer
> distributions like Ubuntu 23.04 because of [PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668).
> Please use the [installation via pipx](#install-using-pipx) instead.

You can install the latest stable release of **greenbone-scap-api** from the
[Python Package Index (pypi)][pypi] using [pip]

    python3 -m pip install --user greenbone-scap-api

## Usage

A simple web server to serve the API can be started by running
`greenbone-scap-api`. The settings of the web server can be controlled via
[environment variables](#settings).

Internally the `greenbone-scap-api` script uses [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)

It's also possible to serve the API with uvicorn directly

```
uvicorn greenbone.scap.api.app:app --reload
```

Using uvicorn directly allows for more flexibility regarding the [settings](https://www.uvicorn.org/settings/)
for serving the API.

After starting the web server the CVE API is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/cves`
by default. [Interactive API docs](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)
are served at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## Settings

**greenbone-scap-api** can be configured via the following environment variables

## Development

**greenbone-scap-api** uses [poetry] for its own dependency management and build
process.

First install poetry via [pipx]

    python3 -m pipx install poetry

Afterwards run

    poetry install

in the checkout directory of **greenbone-scap-api** (the directory containing the
`pyproject.toml` file) to install all dependencies including the packages only
required for development.

Afterwards activate the git hooks for auto-formatting and linting via
[autohooks].

    poetry run autohooks activate

Validate the activated git hooks by running

    poetry run autohooks check
